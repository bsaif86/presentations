# What if the *real* 10× developer was the friends we made along the way?

Every so often the 10× developer trope makes the rounds. The debates get heated: what _is_ a 10× developer? are these traits we should treasure or avoid? do 10× developers even exist?

In this talk, we’ll break down the very real risks of idolizing individual contributors, dig into the nugget of truth that keeps this stereotype alive, and dive into what a _real_ “10× developer” might look like. (Hint: it’s not about code; it’s about people.)

You’ll walk away with a better understanding of individual and team psychology, efficiency and productivity at scale, creating safety and trust for teams, and elevating the entire organization rather than burning out top performers.

## Notes

This talk will dig into a lot of research and psychology around teams, burnout, work-life balance, and career satisfaction/legacy. I’ve worked on teams ranging from a loose collective of freelancers to mega-enterprise teams of 700+ to VC-backed early-stage startups, so I have a lot of experience to draw from and cross-reference to make sure I’m presenting as balanced a take as I can.

This is NOT intended to be a takedown of any individuals or an attack; it’s meant to be a reframing of what “high performing” means, expanding the definition beyond just the technical skills.
