# Designing Toys for Strangers: Software Architecture for Humans

When we write code, we’re not just writing it for ourselves. We need to consider our teammates, future maintainers, and even our future selves who won’t remember all the context about why it’s built this way.

And if we’re open-sourcing our code, we’re writing it for the whole world.

So how can we write code that makes sense to the people who need to use and maintain it? How can we create great defaults and encourage good behavior without taking away developers’ autonomy?

In this session, we’ll look at strategies for software architecture that help provide context and guidance without sacrificing flexibility. Using techniques like progressive disclosure of complexity, we’ll see how we can build intuitive, powerful software that’s maintainable and team-friendly.
