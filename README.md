# Keynotes, Conference Talks, Workshops, and Other Presentations by Jason Lengstorf

I have too many repos that aren't actually useful on their own because they're disjointed presentations, demos, and other nonsense. The goal of this repo is to create a single location where presentations live, including relevant demos, slide decks, and other resources.

## What’s In This Repo?

> Jason has worked as the head of developer relations at Gatsby, a software architect at IBM, as a consultant for companies including PlayStation and Intel, and as an entrepreneur who grew and sold a design agency. Along the way, he’s written several books and dozens of tutorials about development, process and system design, and work-life balance. He uses his eclectic 15+ years of experience to offer a unique, cross-functional approach to solving complex problems.

> Building better careers by first focusing on building better lives is one of Jason’s driving principles, which he writes about at [lengstorf.com](https://lengstorf.com). He focuses on work-life balance, efficiency, processes, and productivity to help people get more done in less time — so they can spend more time on the things that matter most.
