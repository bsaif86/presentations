  //-
    For ‚Äúyou belong here‚Äù to work, communities need to be:
    - welcoming
    - safe
    - compassionate

    But these aren‚Äôt just things that will happen.
    These are actions we need to take. Every. Day.

    As developers, we like to think about problems as finite: we solve them once, and they‚Äôre solved forever. Package it up and put it on npm and it‚Äôll just continue to work that way forever.

    We think of them like puzzles: once the pieces are in place, they tend to stay in place and we‚Äôre free to move onto the next puzzle.

    Communities don‚Äôt work that way.

    Communities are more like spinning plates. Once the plates are up and spinning, they‚Äôll stay spinning for a while, but they require ongoing attention or they‚Äôll fall.

    That means that we can‚Äôt just say our community is welcoming; we have to _be_ welcoming continuously.

    We can‚Äôt just say our community is safe; we have to _create_ a safe community and protect its members.

    We can‚Äôt just say our community is compassionate; we have to _practice_ compassion every day, even when we don‚Äôt understand or disagree.

    What does that look like in practice?

    WELCOMING

    At Gatsby, I wanted to help create the most open, welcoming community on the web. To do that, my team worked on implementing several specific practices to make the community more welcoming:

    1. Freely available pair programming sessions with core team members to help get ramped up as a contributor
    2. A commitment to accessibility as a first-class concern in the community. (Shout-out to Marcy and Amberley.)
    3. Active gratitude for contributors: anyone who contributes to Gatsby gets a coupon code for free swag (or to donate to charity).
    4. Implicit trust for contributors: anyone who contributes to Gatsby is invited to the org, giving them extra privileges and access to maintainers-only discussion.

    We also focused on the tone of our messaging. There‚Äôs a world of difference between a super stiff formal letter and a personable welcome, so we created a friendly robot to post playful, welcoming messages for people.

    SAFE

    The Contributor Covenant is a statement about what kind of community an open source project wants to foster.

    To turn this from a statement into an action, the Node community has implemented both a moderation policy, which describes how to actually enforce the code of conduct, and member expectations that define how members of the project (i.e. leadership) are expected to act.

    This brings up an important point: communities tend to model the behavior of their leaders. So if we want to see open, welcoming, safe communities, the community leaders need to be open, welcoming, and use their power and privilege to maintain a safe space for the rest of the community.
    
    Leaders have to live their values if they hope to see them adopted by others.
